\section{The ScienceIE Task: Specification, Design and Implementation}

A break down of each sub task follows...

\subsection{Subtask 1 - Key Phrase Extraction}
A section all about what I did for part 1
\subsubsection{Method 1: Support Vector Machine}
Go through making the SVM and what tests helped a lot. 
As part 2 has already been described, I think it makes sense here to mention I tried adapting this slightly for task 2 but that it went terribly.
\subsubsection{Method 2: Clustering}
Talk about the experimentation with clustering.

\subsection{ScienceIE Subtask 2 - Key Phrase Classification}
A section all about what I did for part 2
\subsubsection{Word2Vec Classification}
Talk about using word2vec to simply find a good way to quickly classify key phrases with decent results.
*** Where do I fit the SVM for this, as not worth a whole section

\subsection{ScienceIE Subtask 3 - Relation Extraction}
A section all about what I did for part 3
\subsubsection{Support Vector Machine}
Discuss the SVM I tried to do this with (including Word2Vec)

and hopefully more to come...
